# TensorFlow_Beginnings
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

our first step is downloading TensorFlow

$ pip install tensorflow


***** Machine learning power 
****code pipline takes pattern of pre-process your data, build a model, then train the model in a training loops, save the training model as a binary file***


- TensorFlow pattern as describe by offical team

1. Data pre procssing 
2. Data Ingestion
3. Model Evaluation
4. Visualization
5. Serving

import tensorflow as tf

prediction and classification


Tensors is a vector or matrix of 'n dimensions 

If you really want to learn something get a white board and start writting your down down before you type anything.


(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = example_data.load_data()

usage --->  (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
