Neural Networks r cool

building classifiers between data points 

data can be messy, neural networks can find patterns and groups in datasets

all start with an input layer 2 dimensional, just be x coordinate and y coordinate data point


all neural networks have hidden layers, they are neurons, they connect and communicate with input layer
like a human brain 

they transfer information to a output layer, which determines a point's classsifaction
